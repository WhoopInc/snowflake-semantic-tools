      - **Customers**: People who have placed orders. Customer types are:

      - **Orders**: Individual purchase transactions. Order statuses are:
        - "pending" - order placed but not yet processed
        - "completed" - order successfully fulfilled
        - "cancelled" - order was cancelled

      - **Products**: Items available for purchase, categorized by product_category.
